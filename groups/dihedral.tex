\begin{theorem}[Automorphisms form a group]\label{E:aut0}
  Given a set $X$, prove that the collection of all bijections from
  $X$ to itself is a group under function composition.  This group is
  called the \dfn{automorphism group} of $X$, and is denoted
  \[
  \aut(X).
  \]
  \begin{sketch}
    Just check the definition of a group. First show $\aut(X)$ is
    closed under $\circ$. Next explain why the group operation is
    associative. Next find the identity element. Finally, explain why
    every element has an inverse.
  \end{sketch}
\end{theorem}


If you find $\aut(X)$ difficult to think about, don't worry. We'll
take small steps to understand this. 

To start, imagine an equilateral triangle sitting
on an empty $2$D-plane:
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \pic {tikzngon={3}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
We are thinking about the points that lie on the lines that contain
the edges of the triangle.  Call this set of points, this
\dfn{geometric set}, $T$. In symbols we could write
\[
T = \{(x,y):\text{the point $(x,y)$ is on the triangle}\}
\]
Unfortunatly the group $\aut(T)$ seems much to hard (at least at this
point, to this author) to tackle. Instead, let me tell you something I
tell myself in hard times:

\begin{quote}
  For every problem I cannot solve, there's an easier problem that I
  cannot solve.
\end{quote}



So here's my proposal for an eaiser problem. Let's study a subset of
$\aut(T)$. Let's roll it way back to middle school. We'll study the
\textit{symmetries} of $T$. An informal definition of symmetry might be:
\begin{quote}
  Symmetry is immunity to a possible change.
\end{quote}
There are six symmetries of the equilateral triangle. Let's list
them. There are $3$ flips (reflections across lines) $f_1$, $f_2$,
$f_3$:
\[

\]


There are two counterclockwise rotations, $r_{120}$, $r_{240}$:
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \tikzmath{\rrr=1.7;}
  \pic at (0,0) {tikzngon={3}};
  \draw[fill] ({\rrr*sin(0)},{\rrr*cos(0)}) circle (1mm) node[right] {$A$};
  \draw[fill] ({\rrr*sin(360/3)},{\rrr*cos(360/3)}) circle (1mm) node[right] {$C$};
  \draw[fill] ({\rrr*sin(2*360/3)},{\rrr*cos(2*360/3)}) circle (1mm) node[left] {$B$};


  \node[above] at (-2,.5) {$r_{120}$};
  \node[above] at (2,.5) {$r_{240}$};

  \pic at (-4,0) {tikzngon={3}};
  \draw[fill] ({\rrr*sin(0)-4},{\rrr*cos(0)}) circle (1mm) node[right] {$C$};
  \draw[fill] ({\rrr*sin(360/3)-4},{\rrr*cos(360/3)}) circle (1mm) node[right] {$B$};
  \draw[fill] ({\rrr*sin(2*360/3)-4},{\rrr*cos(2*360/3)}) circle (1mm) node[left] {$A$};
  \draw[dashed,->] (-3.5,0) arc (0:120:.5);

  \draw[dashed,->] (4.5,0) arc (0:240:.5);
  
  \draw[->] (-1,.5) -- (-3,.5);
  \draw[->] (1,.5) -- (3,.5);

and an identity symmetry, the ``do nothing'' symmetry. Let's call it
$e$.

\begin{example}[The Dihedral group of order six]
  The six symmetries
  \[
  \{e,r_{120},r_{240},f_1,f_2,f_3\}
  \]
  of the equilateral triangle form a group under function
  composition. This group is known as the \dfn{dihedral group}\textbf{
    of order six}, the \dfn{symmetries of the equilateral triangle},
  and is also called (and denoted) $D_3$.
  \begin{proof}
    Let's check the conditions for this to be a group. We know that
    the operation is associative, since functional composition is
    associative, Lemma~\ref{L:funCompAss}.

    There is an identity element, $e$. Every element we've seen so far
    has an inverse, namely the rotations are inverses of each other,
    and the flips are their own inverse.
    
    We must show that this set is closed under function composition.
    To see this we will make a Cayley table. We will express all the
    symmetries in terms of $e$, $r=r_{120}$, $f=f_2$, with the
    stipulation that when the rotation and flip are applied, we always
    apply the rotation first. Hence
    \[
    r_{240} = r^2, \quad  f_1 = f\circ r, \quad  f_3 = f\circ r^2.
    \]
    In other words, $\{r,f\}$ generate $D_3$.  In our Cayley table
    below, let's ommit the $\circ$, so we will write something like
    $f\circ r$ as simply $fr$.
    \[
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}
    \begin{array}{c!{\vline width 2pt}cccccc}
      (D_3,\circ)& e     & r\cellcolor{blue!12!white}     & r^2\cellcolor{blue!24!white}   & f \cellcolor{red!12!white}    & f r \cellcolor{blue!33!red!24!white}  & f r^2\cellcolor{blue!66!red!24!white} \\  \Xhline{2pt}

      f \cellcolor{red!12!white}         & f \cellcolor{red!12!white}    & f r \cellcolor{blue!33!red!24!white}   & f r^2\cellcolor{blue!50!red!24!white} & e     & r\cellcolor{blue!12!white}    & r^2\cellcolor{blue!24!white}   \\  
      f r \cellcolor{blue!33!red!24!white}        & f r \cellcolor{blue!33!red!24!white}   & f r^2\cellcolor{blue!50!red!24!white} & f \cellcolor{red!12!white}    & r^2\cellcolor{blue!24!white}   & e     & r\cellcolor{blue!12!white}    \\  
      f r^2\cellcolor{blue!50!red!24!white}      & f r^2\cellcolor{blue!50!red!24!white} & f \cellcolor{red!12!white}    & f r \cellcolor{blue!33!red!24!white}   & r\cellcolor{blue!12!white}    & r^2\cellcolor{blue!24!white}   & e     \\  
    \end{array}
    \]
    Note, from the table above we can see that $D_3$ is not Abelian.
  \end{proof}
\end{example}


If a set has symmetry, then that symmetry is a function that doesn't
change the set. In our case, the symmetries map $T$ to itself, and
they maintain the distance between points.  Automorphisms that
maintain the distance between points are called
\index{isometries}\textit{isometries}.

We can define a dihedral group for any regular $n$-gon.

\begin{definition}
  A \dfn{dihedral group} a group of symmetries of the regular
  $n$-gon. We denote this group as $D_n$.
\end{definition}



\begin{exercise}
  Make a Cayley table for $D_4$, the symmetries of the regular $4$-gon:
  \[
  \begin{tikzpicture} %% N-GON
    \pic {tikzegon={4}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \]
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Make a Cayley table for $D_5$, the symmetries of the regular $5$-gon:
  \[
  \begin{tikzpicture} %% N-GON
    \pic {tikzngon={5}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \]
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Make a Cayley table for $D_6$, the symmetries of the regular $6$-gon:
  \[
  \begin{tikzpicture} %% N-GON
    \pic {tikzegon={6}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \]
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
  Prove that $D_n$ is never Abelian.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}\label{E:D2n}
  Let $S$ be a geometric set for a regular $n$-gon.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item How many rotations are there in $\aut(S)$? 
  \item How many flips (reflections across lines) are there in
    $\aut(S)$?
  \item Find the order of $D_n$. 
  \end{enumerate}
  In each case, prove your answer is correct.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Prove that $D_n$ is always generated by two elements, a rotation and
  a flip.
  \begin{hint}
    Explain why there is an element $r$ such that $n$ is the smallest
    natural number such that $r^n =e$ and there is an $f$ such that
    $f^2 = e$.

    Next explain why every element of
    \[
    \{e, r, r^2,\dots,r^{n-1}, f, fr, fr^2 \dots, fr^{n-1}\}
    \]
    is distinct. Finally use Exercise~\ref{E:D2n}.
  \end{hint}
\end{exercise}
