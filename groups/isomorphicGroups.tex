Groups of permutations are very expressive. In fact, every finite group
is isomorphic to a permutation group! To see this we'll need a lemma.

\begin{lemma}[One element per row/column]\label{L:oepr}
  In a Cayley table, each row and each column have exactly one copy of
  each group element.
  \begin{proof}
    Seeking a contradiction, suppose there was a row (or column) of a
    Cayley table that had two copies of the same element, $c$. If this
    row was for a group element $a$, this would mean that there are
    distinct group elements $b_1$ and $b_2$ such that
    \[
    ab_1 =c = ab_2.
    \]
    In this case, we may multiply both sides by $a^{-1}$ on the left,
    to get
    \[
    b_1 = b_2,
    \]
    contradicting the distinctness of $b_1$ and $b_2$.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}


\begin{theorem}[Cayley's theorem]\index{Cayley's theorem}\index{isomorphic!groups}
  Every finite group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
  \begin{proof}
    At this point, we say that finite groups are isomorphic if their
    Cayley tables are the ``same'' just with different symbols.


    Each row of the Cayley table is nothing more than a permutation of
    the symbols used in listing the elements of the group. This means
    that each group element is simply a permutation on all other group
    elements. Thus, every finite group is isomorphic to a group of
    permutations.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[Every finite group is a matrix group]
  Every finite group is isomorphic to a group of orthogonal matrices.
  \begin{proof}
    Every permutation can be represented by an orthogonal matrix.
  \end{proof}
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}
  Currently, we say groups are isomorphic if they can be expressed so
  that their group tables are ``the same.'' In what follows, we will
  explicitly show which elements map to others, and our construction
  (of the permutations/matrices) will ensure that the group tables are
  the same.

  Later in Definition~\ref{D:isomorphism}, you will learn that an
  \dfn{isomorphism} is a bijective function $\phi:(G,\star)\to
  (H,\diamond)$ such that if $a,b\in G$,
  \[
  \phi(a \star b) = \phi(a) \diamond \phi(b).
  \]
  Groups will then be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism mapping
  one group to the other. The line above ensures that multiplication
  in $G$ agrees with multiplication in $H$, and hence the group tables
  will be the same.
\end{remark}




\begin{example}[Representation of $\pmb{\Z_4}$]
  We'll find a permutation group and a matrix group isomorphic to
  $\Z_4$ by explicitly listing a bijective correspondence between the
  elements of the permutation group, the matrix group, and $\Z_4$.
  Write with me:
  \[
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2.5}
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
    0 & \leftrightarrow & \left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\end{smallmatrix}\right) & \leftrightarrow & \left[\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right]\\
    1 & \leftrightarrow & \left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 2 & 3 & 4 & 1\end{smallmatrix}\right) & \leftrightarrow & \left[\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right]\\
    2 & \leftrightarrow & \left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 3 & 4 & 1 & 2\end{smallmatrix}\right) & \leftrightarrow & \left[\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right]\\
    3 & \leftrightarrow & \left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 4 & 1 & 2 & 3\end{smallmatrix}\right) & \leftrightarrow & \left[\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right]\\
  \end{array}
  \]

%% \section{Probability and groups}


%% Suppose you have a list of all isomorphism classes of groups up to
%% order $1024$. This means exactly one group in your list isomorphic to
%% $\{e\}$, $\Z_2$, $\Z_3$, and so on. What percentage of the groups in
%% your list have order $1024$? Well, the answer is somewhat surprising, from the paper \link[\textit{A millennium project: constructing small groups}]{https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218196702001115} by Besche, Eick, and O'Brien, we find that $99\%$ of all groups of order up to $1024$ have order $1024$! What a cool result!
