Let's start by reviewing the groups we know. Here is a
\textbf{noncomprehensive} list of the groups we know:

  (G,\star)                & |G|           & \text{Abelian}        & \text{cyclic}        \\  \Xhline{2pt}

  (\Z_m\times \Z_n,+)      & m\cdot n      & \text{\ding{51}}      & \gcd(m,n) = 1        \\

  (GL(n),\cdot)            & \infty        & n = 1                 & \text{\ding{54}}     \\
  (O(n),\cdot)             & \infty        & n = 1                 & n=1                  \\
  (SO(n),\cdot)            & \infty        & n\le 2                & n=1                  \\
  (Q_8,\cdot)              & 8             & \text{\ding{54}}      & \text{\ding{54}}     \\
  (S_n,\circ)              & n!            & n\le 2                & n\le 2               \\
  (A_n,\circ)              & n!/2          & n\le 3                & n\le 3               \\
\end{array}

Groups of permutations are very expressive. Infact, every finite group
is isomorphic to a permutation group! To see this we'll need a lemma.

\begin{lemma}[One element per row/column]
  In a Cayley table, each row and each column have eactly one copy of
  each group element.
  \begin{proof}
    Seeking a contradiction, suppose there was a row (or column) of a
    Cayley table that had two copies of the same element, $c$. If this
    row was for a group element $a$, this would mean that there are
    distinct group elements $b_1$ and $b_2$ such that
    \[
    ab_1 =c = ab_2.
    \]
    In this case, we may multiply both sides by $a^{-1}$ on the left,
    to get
    \[
    b_1 = b_2,
    \]
    contradicting the distinctness of $b_1$ and $b_2$.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}


\begin{theorem}[Cayley's theorem]\index{Cayley's theorem}
  Every finite group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
  \begin{proof}
    At this point, we say that finite groups are isomorphic if their
    Cayley tables are the ``same'' just with different symbols.


    Each row of the Cayley table is nothing more than a permutation of
    the symbols used in listing the elements of the group. This means
    that each group element is simply a permutation on all other group
    elements. Thus, every finite group is isomorphic to a group of
    permutations.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[Every finite group is a matrix group]
  Every finite group is isomorphic to a matrix group.
  \begin{proof}
    Every permuation can be represented by a matrix.
  \end{proof}
\end{corollary}


\begin{example}
  We'll find a permutation group and a matrix group isomorphic to
  $\Z_4$ by explicitly listing a bijective correspondance between the
  elements of the permutation group, the matrix group, and $\Z_4$.

  Write with me:
  \[
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2.5}
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
    0 & \leftrightarrow & e & \leftrightarrow & \left[\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right]\\
    1 & \leftrightarrow & (1 \ 2 \ 3\ 4) & \leftrightarrow & \left[\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right]\\
    2 & \leftrightarrow & (1 \ 3)(2\ 4) & \leftrightarrow & \left[\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right]\\
    3 & \leftrightarrow & (1 \ 4 \ 3\ 2) & \leftrightarrow & \left[\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right]\\
  \end{array}
  \]
\end{example}

\section{Probability and groups}


Suppose you have a list of all isomorphism classes of groups up to
order $1024$. This means exactly one group in your list isomorphic to
$\{e\}$, $\Z_2$, $\Z_3$, and so on. What percentage of the groups in
your list have order $1024$? Well, the answer is somewhat surprising, from the paper \link[\textit{A millennium project: constructing small groups}]{https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218196702001115} by Besche, Eick, and O'Brien, we find that $99\%$ of all groups of order up to $1024$ have order $1024$! What a cool result!
