\maketitle

Now we will study groups that are generated by a single element. 

\begin{definition}
  A group $G$ is \dfn{cyclic} if it is generated by one element,
  meaning
  \[
  \< a\> := \{a^n:n\in \Z\} = G.
  \]
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
  The group $(\Z,+)$ is a cyclic group.
\end{example}


\begin{example}
  The group $(C,\cdot)$ where $C=\{1,i,-1,-i\}$ is a cyclic group.
\end{example}


\begin{exercise}
  Prove that every cyclic group is Abelian.
\end{exercise}

Let's focus on finite cyclic groups. In this case, there is a
\dfn{canonical} example, meaning most-obvious example: The integers
modulo a natural number. This may sound fancy but it isn't. Imagine
the numbers of a clock, where we replace $12$ with $0$.
\[
\begin{tikzpicture} 
    \pic {tikznclock={12}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
We can add numbers on this clock, for example on this clock $3+4 = 7$
(what else would it be?) as we start at $3$ and then count clockwise
\[
\begin{tikzpicture} 
  \pic {tikznclock={12}};
  \foreach \x in {1,2,...,4}
           {
             \node[]
             at ({2*sin(\x*360/12+3*360/12)},{2*cos(\x*360/12 + 3*360/12}) {\small \x};
           }
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
$4$ more spaces to land on $7$. However, if we want to compute $7+9$,
we need start at $7$ and count clockwise 
\[
\begin{tikzpicture} 
  \pic {tikznclock={12}};
  \foreach \x in {1,2,...,9}
           {
             \node[]
             at ({2*sin(\x*360/12+7*360/12)},{2*cos(\x*360/12 + 7*360/12}) {\small \x};
           }
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
hence, in this case we would say $7+9$ is $4$, modulo $12$. Since
$7+9\ne 4$ in the integers, we usually write
\[
7+9 \equiv 4 \pmod{12}
\]
and say $7+9$ is \dfn{congruent} to $4$ mod $12$. We denote the group
of integers $\{0,1,2,\dots,11\}$ under modular addition as $\Z_{12}$.


Modular arithmetic is closely related to division. Recall the division theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Division theorem]
  Given any integer $n$ and a nonzero integer $d$, there exist unique
  integers $q$ and $r$ such that
  \[
  n = d\cdot q+r\quad\text{where $0\le r< |d|$.}
  \]
  \begin{sketch}
    To establish existance, use the well-ordering principle to find a
    least remainder.

    
    To establish uniqueness, seeking a contradiction, suppose there
    are two remainders. Contradict the fact that the remainder is
    least.
  \end{sketch}
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
  Explain why we can always find an $0\le r<|d|$, such that
  \[
  n \equiv r\pmod{d}.
  \]
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Consider the following picture:
  \[
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \foreach \i in {0,...,2}
    {
      \draw (\i,0) rectangle (1+\i,.5);
      \node at (.5+\i,.25) {$d$};
    }

    \foreach \i in {4,...,6}
    {
      \draw (\i,0) rectangle (1+\i,.5);
      \node at (.5+\i,.25) {$d$};
    }

    \node at(.5+3, .25) {$\cdots$};

    \draw[fill=white!50!gray] (7,0) rectangle (7.4,.5);

    \node at(7.2, .25) {$r$};
    
    \draw[dotted] (7,0) rectangle (8,.5);

    \draw [thick,decoration={brace,mirror,raise=0.2cm},decorate] (0,0) -- (7.4,0)
    node [pos=0.5,anchor=north,yshift=-0.3cm] {$n$};

    \draw [thick,decoration={brace,raise=0.2cm},decorate] (0,.5) -- (7,.5)
    node [pos=0.5,anchor=south,yshift=0.3cm] {$q~d$'s}; 
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \]
  Give a proof of the division theorem based on this picture.
