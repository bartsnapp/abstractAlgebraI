\maketitle
In this section we:

\begin{itemize}
\item Give the definition of a group, explain the idea of finite
  isomorphic groups, and give basic examples of groups.
\item Introduce dihedral groups and the symmetries of the tetrahedron.
\item Introduce cyclic groups and the division theorem.
\item Introduce ideas from number theory and apply them to help us
  understand cyclic groups, including finding generators,
  understanding direct products of cyclic groups (like the Klein
  four-group), and multiplicative groups.
\item Introduce matrix groups and the quaternion group.
\item Introduce permutation groups.
\item Give an example with fifteen puzzles.
\end{itemize}
