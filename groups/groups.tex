\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Let us not mince words:

\begin{definition}
  A \dfn{group} is a set $G$ with an operation $\star$ such that the
  following properties hold:
  \begin{description}
  \item[Closure] If $a,b\in G$, then $a\star b\in G$.
  \item[Associativity] If $a,b,c\in G$, then
    \[
    a\star(b\star c)  = (a\star b)\star c.
    \]
  \item[Identity] There exists $e\in G$ such that for all $a\in G$, 
    \[
    e\star a = a \star e  = a.
    \]
  \item[Inverse] For all $a\in G$, there exists $a^{-1}$ such that
    \[
    a\star a^{-1} = a^{-1}\star a = e.
    \]
  \end{description}
  We will often write a group as $G$, or $(G,\star)$ when the
  operation is not clear.
\end{definition}

  \]
\end{exercise}


\section{Finite groups}


So far, every group we've seen has had an infinite number of
elements. Groups can be finite too.

\begin{definition}
  If $G$ is a group, the \dfn{order} of $G$, denoted $|G|$ is equal to
  the number of distinct elements in $G$.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
  Let $C = \{1,i,-1,-i\}$ where $i =\sqrt{-1}$. We claim that $C$ is a
  group under multiplication.
  \begin{proof}
    First note that $C$ is closed under multiplication. Now also note
    that we know that multiplication is a associative. The identity
    element is $1$, and each element has an inverse, behold:
    \[
    i\cdot (-i) = 1, \quad\text{and}\quad (-1)\cdot(-1) = 1.
    \]
  \end{proof}
\end{example}


\begin{definition}
  Given a finite group $(G,\star)$, a \dfn{group table}, or
  \dfn{Cayley table}, is a complete $\star$-``multiplication'' table
  for $G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  Let's consider the group $C =\{1,i,-1,-i\}$ under multiplication once more.
  Write with me:
  \[
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}
  \begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
    (C,\cdot)& 1     & i     & -1    & -i  \\  \hline\hline
    1        & 1     & i     & -1    & -i  \\  \hline
    i        & i     & -1    & -i    & 1   \\  \hline
    -1       & -1    & -i    & 1     & i   \\  \hline
    -i       & -i    & 1     & i     & -1  \\  \hline
  \end{array}
  \]
  Sometimes, it is best to write a Cayley table using fewer symbols.
  Noting that
  \[
  i^2 = -1 \quad\text{and}\quad i^3 = -i,
  \]
  we can also write:
  \[
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}
  \begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
    (C,\cdot)& 1     & i     & i^2   & i^3 \\  \hline\hline
    1        & 1     & i     & i^2   & i^3 \\  \hline
    i        & i     & i^2   & i^3   & 1   \\  \hline
    i^2      & i^2   & i^3   & 1     & i   \\  \hline
    i^3      & i^3   & 1     & i     & i^2 \\  \hline
  \end{array}
  \]
  You must write the entires of the Cayley table using elements from
  the top-most row; those same elements should also appear in the
  left-most column.
\end{example}




Groups are absolutely fundamental to all of modern mathematics; their
importance cannot be overstated. I remember reading a similar line to
the one that preceeds this one as an undergraduate. I didn't believe
it. However, make no mistake. Group theory permieates all of modern
mathematics. Let me explain.

One of the most powerful insights of 20th-Centuary mathematics is that
to understand an object in mathematics, you should understand the
functions on the object.

At this point, you may be wondering, ``First I'm told groups are
important, then I'm told that functions are important, well\dots which
is it?''

And the answer is, ``Both.'' This is because if you have a set $X$
then the set of all bijections from $X$ to $X$ is a group under
composition, see Exercise~\ref{E:aut0}. Now we will prove a
fundamental lemma.



\begin{lemma}[Function composition is associative]\label{L:funCompAss}
  Suppose that $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are sets and that
  \begin{align*}
    \alpha:A &\to B\\
    \beta:B &\to C\\
    \gamma:C &\to D
  \end{align*}
  are functions. Then,
  \[
  \gamma\circ(\beta\circ\alpha) = (\gamma\circ\beta)\circ\alpha.
  \]
  \begin{proof}
    Let's put our maps in a row and represent the functions as arrows
    between the sets:
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=-1ex]%, column sep=-5ex]
      A \ar[r,"\alpha"] & B \ar[r,"\beta"] & C \ar[r,"\gamma"] & D\\
      a \ar[mapsto,r] & \alpha(a) = b  \ar[mapsto,r] & \beta(b) = c  \ar[mapsto,r] & \gamma(c)=d 
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    The second row above shows where the elements of these sets map
    to. The funny arrow with a base, ``$\mapsto$,'' is how we show
    where elements map. The diagram above represents
    $\gamma\circ\beta\circ\alpha$. In particular, with our diagram, we have set
    \[
    \gamma\circ\beta\circ\alpha(a) = d.
    \]
    Now let's make a similar diagram to
    represent $\gamma\circ(\beta\circ\alpha)$:
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=-1ex]%, column sep=-5ex]
      A \ar[r,"\alpha"] & B \ar[r,"\beta"] & C \ar[r,"\gamma"] & D\\
      a \ar[mapsto,rr,"\beta\circ\alpha",swap] &  & c  \ar[mapsto,r] & d 
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    We see that
    \[
    \gamma\circ(\beta\circ\alpha)(a) = d.
    \]
    Finally, let's make a similar diagram to
    represent $(\gamma\circ\beta)\circ\alpha$:
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=-1ex]%, column sep=-5ex]
      A \ar[r,"\alpha"] & B \ar[r,"\beta"] & C \ar[r,"\gamma"] & D\\
      a \ar[mapsto,r] & b \ar[rr,mapsto,"\gamma\circ\beta",swap] &   & d 
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    Again, we see
    \[
    (\gamma\circ\beta)\circ\alpha(a) = d.
    \]
    Since $a$ is an arbitrary label, and $d$ is simply a label for
    $\gamma\circ\beta\circ\alpha(a)$, we have shown:
    \[
    \gamma\circ(\beta\circ\alpha)(a) = \gamma\circ\beta\circ\alpha(a) = (\gamma\circ\beta)\circ\alpha(a).
    \]
    We conclude that functional composition is always associative.
  \end{proof}

  Prove that addition is an associative operation  over $\Z$.

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that multiplication is an associative operation  over $\Z$.
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
  We write functions on the left, $f(x)$, meaning that the ``$f$'' is
  left of the ``$(x)$.''  Some authors write functions on the right,
  so $(x)f$. Why would an author do this? Hint: Rephrase the lemma
  above, writing the functions on the right, and see if you notice
  anything nice.
  \begin{hint}
    Think about this:
    \[
    \underbrace{\gamma\circ\beta\circ\alpha}_{\text{left}}(a) = (a)\underbrace{\alpha\circ\beta\circ\gamma}_{\text{right}}
    \]
  \end{hint}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
  Prove that matrix multiplication is associative.
  \begin{hint}
    An $n\times m$ matrix is a function mapping $\R^m\to \R^n$ when
    you write your vectors vertically and functions on the left.
  \end{hint}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
  Let
  \begin{align*}
    f(x) &= \frac{1}{x},  &  m(x) &= \frac{1}{1-x}, \\
    g(x) &= 1-x,          &  n(x) &= \frac{x-1}{x}, \\
    h(x) &= \frac{x}{x-1}, &  i(x) &= x.
  \end{align*}
  Prove that $\{i,f,g,h,m,n\}$ forms a group under function
  composition.

  ORDER OF FXNS AND GROUP TABLE?
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Pick up a sock. Now choose one:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[$(n)$] Do nothing to the sock.
  \item[$(i)$] Pull the toe of the sock out the inside of the foot
    opening. Hence if the sock was rightside out, it is now inside
    out, and vice versa.
  \end{enumerate}
  Someone says,
  \begin{quote}
    Ah! The sock group! The set $\{n,i\}$ is a group with
    \begin{align*}
      r\circ r &= r\\
  r\circ i &= i\\
  i\circ i &= r.
  \end{align*}
  \end{quote}
  Explain what this ``groupie'' is taking about. Be very
  detailed. Make a Cayley table with entries $n$ and $r$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  In the Ohio State University Marching Band, there is a fundamental
  movement called a ``270-spin-turn.'' With this turn, the band-member
  spins to the left, $270^\circ$, thus ends up facing right. Denote a
  $270$-spin-turn by $T$. Explain how
  \[
  \{T^0,T^1,T^2,T^3\}
  \]
  form a group. Make a Cayley table for $T$ where the entires are
  $\{T^0,T^1,T^2,T^3\}$.
\end{exercise}







\begin{exercise}[Automorphisms form a group]\label{E:aut0}
  Given a set $X$, prove that the collection of all bijections from
  $X$ to itself is a group under function composition.  This group is
  called the \dfn{automorphism group} of $X$, and is denoted
  \[
  \aut(X).
  \]
  \begin{hint}
    Just check the definition of a group. First show $\aut(X)$ is
    closed under $\circ$. Next explain why the group operation is
    associative. Next find the identity element. Finally, explain why
    every element has an inverse.
  \end{hint}
\end{exercise}


If you find $\aut(X)$ difficult to think about, don't worry. We'll
take small steps to understand this. To start, imagine an equilateral
triangle sitting on an empty $2$D-plane:
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[ultra thick,rounded corners=.5] (0,0) -- (3,0) -- (1.5,2.6) -- cycle;
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
We are thinking about the points that lie on the lines that contain
the edges of the triangle.  Call this set of points, this
\dfn{geometric set}, $T$. In symbols we could write
\[
T = \{(x,y):\text{the point $(x,y)$ is on the triangle}\}
\]
Unfortunatly the group $\aut(T)$ seems much to hard (at least at this
point, to this author) to tackle. Instead, let me tell you something I
tell myself in hard times:

\begin{quote}
  For every problem I cannot solve, there's an easier problem that I
  cannot solve.
