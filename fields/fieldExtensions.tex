\begin{definition}
  Given fields $K\subset L$, $L$ is a \dfn{field extension} of $K$ if
  the field operations and identities $L$ restrict to the field
  operations of $K$. If there are several field extensions, say $k
  \subset K \subset L$ we often write
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    L\ar[d,-] \\
    K \ar[d,-]\\
    k
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  and call this a \dfn{tower of field extensions}. In this case, $k$ is called the \dfn{ground field}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Reals and rationals]
  The real numbers are a field extension of the rational numbers,
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \R\ar[d,-] \\
    \Q
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  and here $\Q$ is the ground field. In particular, if $K$ is a field
  of characteristic zero, $K$ is (isomorphic to) a field extension of $\Q$.
\end{example}



\begin{example}[Fields adjoin an element]
  Given a field $K$, we may adjoin an element $\alpha$ by writing
  \[
  K[\alpha] =\{\text{polynomials in terms of $\alpha$ with
    coefficients in $K$}\}.
  \]
  This may or may not be a field depending on $\alpha$. 
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
  Define:
  \[
  \Q[\sqrt{2}] = \{ a+ b\sqrt{2}: a,b,\in\Q\}.
  \]
  Prove that $\Q[\sqrt{2}]$ is a field.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove or disprove that
  \[
  \Z_5[i] = \{a + b i: a,b\in\Z_5\}
  \]
  is a field.
\end{exercise}


\begin{example}[Rationals and some irrationals]
  The stucture of field extensions can be more complicated than the
  first example. Consider
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    & \Q[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]\ar[rd,-] \ar[d,-] \ar[ld,-]& \\
    \Q[\sqrt{2}] \ar[rd,-]& \Q[\sqrt{6}] \ar[d,-]& \Q[\sqrt{3}]\ar[ld,-]\\
    &  \Q & 
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  again, $\Q$ is the ground field.  The reader should verify that each
  of
  \begin{align*}
    \Q[\sqrt{2}] &=\{a + b\sqrt{2}: a,b\in \Q\},\\
    \Q[\sqrt{3}] &=\{a + b\sqrt{3}: a,b\in \Q\},\\
    \Q[\sqrt{6}] &=\{a + b\sqrt{6}: a,b\in \Q\},\\
    \Q[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}] &=\{a + b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}: a,b,c,d\in \Q\},
  \end{align*}
  are in fact fields.
\end{example}



\begin{lemma}[Field extensions are vector spaces]
  If $L$ is a field extension of $K$, then $L$ is a $K$-vector space.
  \begin{sketch}
    Check the conditions of the definition of a vector space.
  \end{sketch}
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}\index{degree!of a field extension}
  If $L$ is a field extension of $K$, then we define the
  \textbf{degree} of a $L$ over $K$ to be the dimension of $L$ as a
  $K$-vector space. We denote the degree of $L$ over $K$ with
  $[L:K]$. In short,
  \[
  [L:K] = \dim_K(L).
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Complex numbers]
  The complex numbers
  \[
  \C = \{a+bi:a,b\in\R\}
  \]
  are a field extension of $\R$. Since a basis of $\C$ over $\R$ is
  $\{1,i\}$, we see $\dim_\R(\C)=2$ and so we say $[\C:\R]=2$. The
  field $\C$ is a degree two extension of $\R$.
\end{example}


\begin{lemma}[Degree is multiplicative]
  Let $k\subset K\subset L$ be a tower of field extensions,
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=0pt]
    L\ar[d,-,"{[L:K]}",swap]  &             &  L\ar[dd,-,"{[L:K]\cdot [K:k]}"]   \\
    K \ar[d,-,"{[K:k]}",swap] & \Rightarrow &     \\
    k                         &             &  k
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  In this case $[L:K]\cdot [K:k] = [L:k]$.
  \begin{proof}
    Let
    \[
    A = \{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_m\}\subset L
    \]
    be a basis for $L$ as a $K$-vector space. Let
    \[
    B = \{\beta_1,\beta_2,\dots,\beta_n\}\subset K
    \]
    be a basis for $K$ as a $k$-vector space. We'll show that
    \[
    C = \{\alpha_i\cdot \beta_j:\alpha_i\in A \text{ and }\beta_j\in B\} \subset L
    \]
    is a basis for $L$ as a $k$-vector space. Since $C$ has
    $[L:K]\cdot [K:k]$ elements, this will prove the result.

    We must show that $C$ spans $L$ as a $k$-vector space and that $C$
    is a linearly independent set of vectors in a $k$-vector space.

    \textbf{$\boldsymbol C$ spans $\boldsymbol L$ as a $\boldsymbol k$-vector space.} Suppose
    that $\l\in L$. Since $L$ is a $K$-vector space, we may write
    \[
    \l = a_1\alpha_1 + a_2 \alpha_2 + \cdots + a_m\alpha_m,
    \]
    where each $a_i\in K$. However, $K$ is a $k$-vector space, so for
    each $i$, we may write
    \[
    a_i = b_{i,1}\beta_1 +  b_{i,2}\beta_2 + \cdots +   b_{i,n}\beta_n
    \]
    where each $b_{i,j}\in k$. Substituting in, we can express $\l$ as
    a linear combination of vectors of the form $\alpha_i\cdot
    \beta_j$. Hence $C$ spans $L$ as a $k$-vector space.



    \textbf{$\boldsymbol C$ is a linear independent set of vectors.}
    Suppose that there is a linear relation
    \begin{align*}
      0 = &c_{1,1} \alpha_1\beta_1 + c_{1,2} \alpha_1\beta_2 + \cdots + c_{1,n} \alpha_1\beta_n\\
      +&c_{2,1} \alpha_2\beta_1 + c_{2,2} \alpha_2\beta_2 + \cdots + c_{2,n} \alpha_2\beta_n\\
      &\vdots\\
      +&c_{m,1} \alpha_m\beta_1 + c_{m,2} \alpha_m\beta_2 + \cdots + c_{m,n} \alpha_m\beta_n,
    \end{align*}
    where $c_{i,j}\in k$. Factor out $\alpha_i$ to find
    \begin{align*}
      0 = &\alpha_1(c_{1,1} \beta_1 + c_{1,2} \beta_2 + \cdots + c_{1,n} \beta_n)\\
      +&\alpha_2(c_{2,1} \beta_1 + c_{2,2} \beta_2 + \cdots + c_{2,n} \beta_n)\\
      &\vdots\\
      +&\alpha_m(c_{m,1} \beta_1 + c_{m,2} \beta_2 + \cdots + c_{m,n} \beta_n),
    \end{align*}
    where each 
    \[
    (c_{i,1} \beta_1 + c_{i,2} \beta_2 + \cdots + c_{i,n} \beta_n)\in K.
    \]
    Since $A$ is a set of linearly independent vectors, we see that
    for each $i= 1,\dots, m$
    \[
    (c_{i,1} \beta_1 + c_{i,2} \beta_2 + \cdots + c_{i,n} \beta_n) = 0.
    \]
    However, since $B$ is a basis for $K$ as a $k$-vector space, we
    see each $c_{i,j}=0$. This completes the proof.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}[Finite extensions]
  If $k\subset K\subset L$ is a tower of field extensions
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=0pt]
    L\ar[d,-,"\text{finite}",swap] & & L\ar[dd,-,"\text{finite}"]\\
    K \ar[d,-,"\text{finite}",swap] & \Rightarrow& \\
    k & \vphantom{K} & k
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  and $[K:k]<\infty$ and $[L:K]<\infty$, then $[L:k]<\infty$.
\end{corollary}



\section{Algebraic extensions}

\begin{definition}
  Let $K\subset L$ be a field extension. The field $L$ is an
  \dfn{algebraic extension} over $K$ if for every element $\alpha\in
  L$, there exists $f(x) \in K[x]$ such that $f(\alpha) = 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[$\pmb{\C}$ is algebraic over $\pmb{\R}$]
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
  A field $K$ is called \textbf{algebraically closed} if every
  polynomial of positive degree in $K[x]$ has a root in $K$. For
  example, $\C$ is algebraically closed but $\R$ is not. Prove that
  every algebraically closed field has an infinite number of elements.
\end{exercise}


\begin{definition}
  Let $K\subset L$ be an algebraic extension of fields with
  $\alpha\in L$. A polynomial $f(x)\in K[x]$ is called a \dfn{minimal
    polynomial} for $\alpha$ if for all $g(x)\in K[x]$,
  \[
  g(\alpha) = 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \deg(f(x)) \le \deg(g(x)).
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Minimal polynomials]
  Let $a+bi$ be any complex number where $a,b\in\R$ and $b\ne 0$. A
  minimal polynomial for this complex number is
  \[
  (x-(a+bi))(x-(a-bi)) = x^2 -2ax +a^2 + b^2\in\R[x].
  \]
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}[Minimal polynomials and division]
  Let $K$ be a field and $f(x)\in K[x]$. If $f(x)$ is a minimal
  polynomial for $\alpha$ over $K$, and $g(\alpha) = 0$, then $f(x) |
  g(x)$.
  \begin{proof}
    Seeking a contradiction, suppose that $g(\alpha) = 0$ and $f(x)
    \nmid g(x)$. Then
    \[
    g(x) = f(x) \cdot q(x) + r(x), \quad 0<\deg(r(x))< \deg(f(x)).
    \]
    Now evaluate at $x = \alpha$,
    \begin{align*}
      g(\alpha) &= f(\alpha) \cdot q(\alpha) + r(\alpha),\\
      0 &= 0 + r(\alpha),
    \end{align*}
    so $r(\alpha)=0$, but this is a contradiction, as the degree of
    $r(x)$ is less than the degree of the minimal polynomial.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}




\begin{lemma}[Minimal polynomials are irreducible]
  Let $K$ be a field and $f(x)\in K[x]$. If $f(x)$ is a minimal
  polynomial for $\alpha$ over $K$, then $f(x)$ is irreducible in
  $K[x]$.
  \begin{proof}
    Seeking a contradiction, suppose that $f(x)$ is a minimal
    polynomial for $\alpha$ over $K$ and that
    \[
    f(x) = g(x) \cdot h(x) 
    \]
    where
    \[
    \deg(g(x)) <\deg(f(x))\text{and}\quad\deg(h(x)) <\deg(f(x)).
    \]
    Now $f(\alpha) = 0$ implies that $g(\alpha) =0$ or $h(\alpha) =
    0$, but the degrees of both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are both less than
    the degree of $f(x)$, the minimal polynomial. This is a
    contradiction.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}\index{Kalpha@$K(\alpha)$}
  Let $K$ be a field and let $\alpha$ be a element that is algebraic
  over $K$. In this case,
  \[
  K(\alpha) := \{\text{smallest field containing $K$ and $\alpha$}\}
  \]
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}[Field extensions and conrguence]
  Let $K$ be a field and $f(x)\in K[x]$ be a minimal polynomial for
  $\alpha$. In this case
  \[
  K(\alpha) \iso K[x]/(f(x)).
  \]
  \begin{sketch}
  \end{sketch}
\end{lemma}


\begin{theorem}[Degree of an algebraic extension]
  Let $K$ be a field and let $\alpha$ be algebraic over $K$ with
  minimal polynomial $f(x)\in K[x]$. Then
  \[
  \dim_K(K(\alpha)) = [K(\alpha):K] = \deg(f(x)) = n,
  \]
  and
  \[
  \{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\dots,\alpha^{n-1}\}
  \]
  is a basis for $K(\alpha)$ as a $K$-vector space.
  \begin{proof}
    Since $K(\alpha)$ is a field that contains $\alpha$, it also contains
    \[
    1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \dots, \alpha^{n-1}.
    \]
    Set $V$ to be the $K$-vector space spanned by
    \[
    A = \{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\dots,\alpha^{n-1}\}.
    \]
    We claim that $A$ is a basis for $V$ over $K$. First we'll show
    that the set $A$ is a set of linearly independent vectors.

    Seeking a contradiction, suppose that $A$ consists of linearly
    dependent vectors, so we may write
    \[
    c_0 + c_1\alpha_1 + \cdots + c_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1} =0
    \]
    where $c_i\ne 0$ for some $i$. But now $\alpha$ is a root of a
    polynomial of degree $n-1$, a contradiction, since the degree of
    the minimal polynomial for $\alpha$ is $n$.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
