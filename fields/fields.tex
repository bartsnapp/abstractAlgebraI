\maketitle

In this section we will introduce fields, which are objects that are a
bit like two groups at once.


\begin{definition}
  A \dfn{field} is a set $K$ with two operations that we will denote
  by $+$ and $\cdot$, and call addition and multiplication, such that
  the following properties hold:
  \begin{description}
  \item[Abelian group under addition] $(K,+)$ is an Abelian
    group with identity element denoted by $0$.
  \item[Abelian group under multiplication] $(K-\{0\},\cdot)$ is
    an Abelian group with identity element denoted by $1$.
  \item[Distributivity] The operation $\cdot$ distributes over $+$,
    meaning that if $a,b,c\in K$,
    \[
    a\cdot (b+ c) = a\cdot b+ a\cdot c \quad\text{and}\quad (a+ b)\cdot c  = a\cdot c+ b\cdot c.
    \]
  \end{description}
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise} 
  Which of the following are fields under the canonical operations?
  Select all that apply.
  \begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{$\Q$}
    \choice[correct]{$\R$}
    \choice[correct]{$\C$}
    \choice{$\Z$}
    \choice[correct]{$\Z_p$ where $p$ is a prime number}
    \choice{$\Z_m^\times$}
  \end{selectAll}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $K$ be a field. Prove that $(-1)\cdot a = (-a)$.
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
  Note, in the definition of a field, the elements ``$0$'' and ``$1$''
  are not necessarily the integers who look and sound the same. In
  particular, nowhere in the definition of a field does it state what
  how $0$ acts on field elements by field multiplication. Prove or
  disprove: $a\cdot 0 = 0$.
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
  Let $K$ be a field. Prove that ${\left(ab^{-1}\right)}\hspace{0pt}^{-1} = a^{-1}
  b$. Note, here you are using the definition of a field to show
  \[
  \frac{1}{a/b} = \frac{b}{a}.
  \]
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} 
  Let $a$ and $b$ be elements of a field $K$. Prove that if $a\cdot b
  = 0$, then $a$ is zero or $b$ is zero. 
\end{exercise}




\begin{exercise} 
  When is $\Z_n$ definitely not a field?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{E:FF4}
  Describe a field with four elements.
  \begin{hint}
    Trial and error with a Cayley table for addition and a Cayley
    table for multiplication is not a bad way to start.
  \end{hint}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}\label{E:FF6} Can you find a field with six elements?
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Let $K$ be a field. Prove that $K\times K$ is never a field under
  componenetwise addition and componenetwise multiplication.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} 
Let $K$ be a field. Find some quality inherent in $K$ that is
necessary and sufficient to make the set of ordered pairs in $K\times
K$ a field when ``addition'' is defined by $\diamond$ and
``multiplication'' is defined by $\star$:
\[
(a,b)\diamond (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)\qquad\text{and}\qquad (a,b)\star (c,d) =
(ac-bd,ad+bc).
\]
Hint: What if $K = \R$? What if $K = \C$? Keep on going!
\end{exercise}






Fields can be dichotomized by their \textit{characteristic}.

\begin{definition}
The \dfn{characteristic} of a field $K$ is the least positive
integer $n$ such that
\[
\underbrace{1 + 1 + \cdots +1}_{\text{$n$ times}} =0.
\]
If there is no such positive integer, then we say that $K$ has
characteristic $0$.
\end{definition}


\begin{exercise}
  Prove that if a field has characteristic $0$, then it contains a
  subgroup isomorphic to $\Z$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that if a field has characteristic $p$, then it contains a
  subgroup isomorphic to $\Z_p$.
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise} 
Prove that if a field has finite characteristic, then its
characteristic is a prime number.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\index{freshman binomial theorem}\label{E:FBT}
Prove that in a field of positive characteristic $p$, the so-called
\textit{freshman binomial theorem} holds:
\[
(a+b)^p = a^p + b^p
\]
\end{exercise}





\begin{definition}\index{homomorphism!of fields}\index{field homomorphism}
  Let $K$ and $L$ be fields. A function
  \[
  \phi:K\to L
  \]
  is a \dfn{homomorphism} of fields if
  \[
  \phi(a+b) = \phi(a)+\phi(b)\quad\text{and}\quad\phi(a\cdot b) = \phi(a)\cdot \phi(b),
  \]
  where the operations on the left-hand side of the equations might not
  be the operations on right-hand side of the equations. 
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $\phi:K\to L$ be a homomorphism of fields. Prove that
  \[
  \phi(0_K) = 0_L\quad\text{and}\quad\phi(1_K) = 1_L.
  \]
\end{exercise}


\begin{definition}\index{kernel!field homomorphism}
  Let $\phi: K\to L$ be a homomorphism of fields. The \textbf{kernel}
  of $\phi$ is
  \[
  \ker(\phi) := \{a\in K:\phi(a) = 0_L\}.
  \]
  The \dfn{image} of $\phi$ is
  \[
  \im(\phi) = \{\phi(a):a\in K\}.
  \]
\end{definition}


\begin{exercise}
  Let $\phi:K\to L$ be a homomorphism of fields. Prove that $\phi$ is
  injective if and only if $\ker(\phi) = \{0\}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $\phi:K\to L$. Prove that $\phi$ is either injective or the zero
  map.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that every surjective homomorphism of fields is a bijective
  homomorphism of fields.
\end{exercise}



\begin{example}[The Frobenius homomorphism]\index{Frobenius homomorphism}
  Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $p$. Prove that
  \begin{align*}
    \phi:K &\to K\\
    a &\mapsto a^p
  \end{align*}
  is a homomorphism of fields. Is the Frobenius homomorphism surjective?
\end{example}
