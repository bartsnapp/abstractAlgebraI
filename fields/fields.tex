In this section we will introduce fields, talk about vector spaces,
and then return to fields.


\section{Fields}


\begin{definition}
  A \dfn{field} is a set $K$ with two operations that we will denote
  by $+$ and $\cdot$ such that the following properties hold:
  \begin{description}
  \item[Abelian group under $\pmb{+}$] $(K,+)$ is an Abelian
    group with identity element denoted by $0$.
  \item[Abelian group under $\pmb{\cdot}$] $(K-\{0\},\cdot)$ is
    an Abelian group with identity element denoted by $1$.
  \item[Distributivity] The operation $\cdot$ distrbutes over $+$,
    meaning if $a,b,c\in K$,
    \[
    a\cdot (b+ c) = a\cdot b+ a\cdot c \quad\text{and}\quad (a+ b)\cdot c  = a\cdot c+ b\cdot c.
    \]
  \end{description}
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise} 
  Which of the following are fields under the canonical operations?
  Select all that apply.
  \begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{$\Q$}
    \choice[correct]{$\R$}
    \choice[correct]{$\C$}
    \choice{$\Z$}
    \choice[correct]{$\Z_p$ where $p$ is a prime number}
    \choice{$\Z_m^\times$}
  \end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $K$ be a field. Prove that $(-1)\cdot a = (-a)$.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} 
  Let $a$ and $b$ be elements of a field $K$. Prove that if $a\cdot b
  = 0$, then $a$ is zero or $b$ is zero. 
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Note, in the definition of a field, the elements ``$0$'' and ``$1$''
  are not necessarily the integers who look and sound the same. In
  particular, nowhere in the definiton of a field does it state what
  how $0$ acts on field elements by field multiplication. Prove or
  disprove: $a\cdot 0 = 0$.
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise} 
  When is $\Z_n$ definitely not a field?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{E:FF4}
  Describe a field with four elements.
  \begin{hint}
    Trial and error with a Cayley table for addition and a Cayley
    table for multiplication is not a bad way to start.
  \end{hint}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}\label{E:FF6} Can you find a field with six elements?
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} 
Let $K$ be a field. Find some quality inherent in $K$ that is
necessary and sufficient to make the set of ordered pairs in $K\times
K$ a field when ``addition'' is defined by $\diamond$ and
``multiplication'' is defined by $\star$:
\[
(a,b)\diamond (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)\qquad\text{and}\qquad (a,b)\star (c,d) =
(ac-bd,ad+bc).
\]
Hint: What if $K = \R$? What if $K = \C$? Keep on going!
\end{exercise}






Fields can be dichotomized by their \textit{characteristic}.

\begin{definition}
The \dfn{characteristic} of a field $K$ is the least positive
integer $n$ such that
\[
\underbrace{1 + 1 + \cdots +1}_{\text{$n$ times}} =0.
\]
If there is no such positive integer, then we say that $K$ has
characteristic $0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise} 
Prove that if a field has finite characteristic, then its
characteristic is a prime number.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\index{freshman binomial theorem}\label{E:FBT}
Prove that in a domain of positive characteristic $p$, the so-called
\textit{freshman binomial theorem} holds:
\[
(a+b)^p = a^p + b^p
\]
\end{exercise}





\begin{definitio}\index{homomorphism!of fields}\index{field homomorphism}
  Let $K$ and $L$ be fields. A function
  \[
  \phi:K\to L
  \]
  is a \dfn{homomorphism} of fields if
  \[
  \phi(a+b) = \phi(a)+\phi(b)\quad\text{and}\quad\phi(a\cdot b) = \phi(a)\cdot \phi(b),
  \]
  where the operations on the left-hand side of the equations might not
  be the operations on right-hand side of the equations. 
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $\phi: K\to L$
\end{exercise}
