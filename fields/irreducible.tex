\maketitle

From our previous work, we know that $K[x]/(n(x)$ is a field if and
only if $n(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial. Let's figure out some
strategies to determine if a polynomial is irreducible. In particular,
we are interested in showing that polyomials in $\Q[x]$ are
irreducible.

\section{Degree two or three}

\begin{lemma}[Irreducibility for degree two and three]
  Let $K$ be a field and $f(x)\in K[x]$ where $2 \le deg(f(x))\le 3$. In
  this case, $f(x)$ is irreducible if and only if $f(x)$ has no roots
  in $K$.
  \begin{sketch}
    If $2 \le deg(f(x))\le 3$ and $f(x)$ factors, then it must have a
    factor of degree $1$.
  \end{sketch}
\end{lemma}






\section{Changing coefficients}

So far, we've been thinking about polynomials whose coefficients are
field elements. This doesn't have to be the case. Define
\[
\Z[x] = \{\text{polynomials in terms of $x$ with coefficients in
  $\Z$}\}.
\]

When the polynomial has integer coefficients, there is an easy way to
find rational roots.

\begin{lemma}[Rational roots test]
  Let $K$ be a field and let $f(x) \in \Z[x]$,
  \[
  f(x) = c_nx^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 x + c_0.
  \]
  If $\frac{r}{s}\in\Q$ is in lowest terms and $\frac{r}{s}$ is a root
  of $f(x)$, then
  \[
  r | c_0 \quad\text{and}\quad s | c_n.
  \]
  \begin{proof}
    Evaluate $f\left(\frac{r}{s}\right)$ and clear denominators.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Even if the degree of the polynomial you are working with is higher
than two or three, the rational roots test allows you to easily find
linear factors.


\begin{lemma}[Reduction to characteristic $\boldsymbol p$]
  Given a polynomial in $\Z_p[x]$, if $f(x)$ is irreducible in
  $\Z_p[x]$ for some prime $p$, then $f(x)$ is irreducible in $\Z[x]$.
  \begin{sketch}
    Prove the contrapostive of the statement.
  \end{sketch}
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}[Gauss' lemma]\index{Gauss' lemma}
  Given a polynomial $f(x)\in\Z[x]$, if $f(x)$ is irreducible in
  $\Z[x]$, then $f(x)$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$.
  \begin{proof}
    We'll prove the contrapositive of this statement. Suppose $f(x) =
    g(x)\cdot h(x)$ where $g(x),h(x)\in\Q[x]$. Let $d$ be a common
    denominator for the coefficients of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Hence
    \[
    d\cdot f(x) = g'(x)\cdot h'(x)
    \]
    where $g'(x) = d\cdot g(x)\in \Z[x]$ and $h'(x) = d \cdot
    h(x)\in\Z[x]$. We may factor
    \[
    d = p_1,\dots, p_n.
    \]
    Since $p_1$ divides $d$, $p_1$ divides the coefficients of
    $g'(x)\cdot h'(x)$.


    We claim that $p_1$ divides all the coefficients of $g'(x)$ or
    $p_1$ divides all the coefficients of $h'(x)$.  Let $a_i$
    represent the coefficients of $g'(x)$ and $b_j$ represent the
    coefficients of $h'(x)$. Seeking a contradiction, suppose 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $a_n$ be the first coefficient of $g'(x)$ that is not
        divisible by $p_1$.
      \item $b_m$ be the first coefficient of $h'(x)$ that is not
        divisible by $p_1$.
    \end{itemize}
    Writing out the coefficient of $x_{m+n}$ of $d\cdot f(x)$, we have
    \[
    \underbrace{a_0b_{m+n}  + \cdots + a_{n-1}b_{m+1}}_{\text{divisible by $p_1$}} + a_nb_m + \underbrace{a_{n+1}b_{m-1} + \cdots + a_{m+n} b_0}_{\text{divisible by $p_1$}}
    \]
    Since this entire expression is divisible by $p_1$, we conclude
    that $a_nb_m$ is divisible by $p_1$. Now by Euclid's lemma,
    Corollary~\ref{L:EL2}, this means $p|a_n$ or $p|b_m$. Hence $p_1$
    divides all the coefficients of $g'(x)$ or $p_1$ divides all the
    coefficients of $h'(x)$. This means that
    \[
    g'(x)/p \in \Z[x] \quad\text{or}\quad h'(x)/p \in \Z[x]
    \]
    Repeat for every prime factor of $d$ to see that $f(x)$ factors in
    $\Z[x]$.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Now we have the following:
\[
\text{Irreducible in $\Z_p[x]$} \Rightarrow \text{Irreducible in $\Z[x]$}  \Rightarrow \text{Irreducible in $\Q[x]$}
\]


\section{Eisenstein's criterion}



\begin{theorem}[Eisenstein's criterion]\index{Eisenstein's criterion}
  Given a polynomial $f(x) \in\Z[x]$
  \[
  f(x) = c_nx^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 x + c_0,
  \]
  if there exists a prime $p$ such that
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $p|c_i$ for $i \ne n$,
  \item $p\nmid c_n$, and
  \item $p^2\nmid c_0$,
  \end{enumerate}
  then $f(x)$ is irreducible in $\Z[x]$.
  \begin{proof}
    Seeking a contradiction, suppose that $f(x)$ factors in $\Z[x]$ and there exists a prime $p$ such that
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $p|c_i$ for $i \ne n$,
  \item $p\nmid c_n$,
  \item $p^2\nmid c_0$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Write
  \[
  f(x) = g(x) \cdot h(x)
  \]
  where
  \begin{align*}
    g(x) &= a_rx^r + \cdots + a_1 x+ a_0\\
    h(x) &= b_sx^s + \cdots + b_1 x+ b_0,
  \end{align*}
  and $r + s = n = \deg(f(x))$. Multiplying $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ and
  examining coefficients we find
  \begin{align*}
    c_0 &= a_0b_0\\
    c_1 &= a_0b_1 + a_1 b_0\\
    &\vdots \\
    c_n &= a_r b_s.
  \end{align*}
  If $p| c_0$, then by Euclid's lemma, Corollary~\ref{C:EL2}, we have
    that $p|a_r$ or $p|b_s$, but not both as $p^2\nmid c_0$. WLOG
    assume $p|a_0$ and $p\nmid b_0$.

    Since $p|c_1$, then by Euclid's lemma, Corollary~\ref{C:EL2}, we have
      that $p|a_1$ or $p|b_0$. Since $p\nmid b_0$, we see
      $p|a_1$. Continuing on in this fashion, we see $p|c_i$ for all
      $i$ implies $p| a_i$, $i=1,\dots, r$. But this means
      \[
      p|a_rb_s \quad\Leftrightarrow p|c_n,
      \]
      a contradiction. 
  \end{proof}
