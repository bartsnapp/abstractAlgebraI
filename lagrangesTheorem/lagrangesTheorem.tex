\begin{definition}
  Let $S$ be a subrgoup of a finite group $G$. The \dfn{index} of $S$ in $G$, denoted
  \[
  [G:S] = \text{(number of left cosets)}
  \]
  is number of left cosets of $S$.\index{index@$[G:S]$}
\end{definition}



\begin{theorem}[Lagrange]
  If $G$ is a finite group with subgroup $S$, then 
  \[
  |G| = [G:S]\cdot |S|.
  \]
  \begin{proof}
    First note that by Proposition~\ref{P:CSG}, $|S| = |gS|$. By
    Theorem~\ref{T:CPG}, $G$ is partitoned by the left cosets of
    $S$. This means that every element of $G$ is in exactly one left
    coset. Hence
    \[
    |G| = [G:S]\cdot |S|.
    \]
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
  Let $G$ be a finite group with $g\in G$. In this case, the order of
  $g$ divides the order of $G$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
  Let $G$ be a group where $|G|= p$, a prime number. Then $G$ is
  cyclic and any element $g\in G$, $g\ne e$, can act as a generator.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
  Let $S \subgp T \subgp G$ be subgroups of a finite group
  $G$. Then
  \[
  [G:S] = [G:T]\cdot [T:S].
  \]
\end{corollary}

You may wonder, is the converse of Lagrange's theorem true?
