\begin{definition}
  Let $(G,\star)$ be a group. A subgroup $N\subgp G$ is a \dfn{normal subgroup}
  if
  \[
  a\star N = N\star a,
  \]
  meaning every left coset is equal to the right coset involving the
  same group element. In this case we write $N\normal G$. \index{normal@$\normal$}
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
  If $G$ is an Abelian group and $N\subgp G$, then $N\normal G$.
\end{corollary}




\begin{lemma}[Normal subgroup criterion]
  A subgroup $N\subgp G$ is normal if and only if for all $n\in N$ and
  all $g\in G$,
  \[
  gng^{-1}\in N.
  \]
  \begin{proof}
    $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that $N\normal G$. In this case, for all
    $g\in G$
    \[
    gN = Ng.
    \]
    This means that for all $n\in N$, there exist $n'\in N$ such
    that
    \[
    g n = n'g.
    \]
    since $G$ is a group, we may multiply both sides by $g^{-1}$ on
    the right to obtain
    \[
    g n g^{-1} = n'\in N.
    \]
    This completes this direction of the proof.

    $(\Leftarrow)$ Now suppose for all $n\in N$ and $g\in G$ 
    \[
    gng^{-1} \in \N.
    \]
    This means there is a $n'\in N$ such that
    \begin{align*}
      gng^{-1}  &= n'\\
      gn = n'g.
    \end{align*}
    Thus, $gN =Ng$, and we see $N$ is normal.
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that every subgroup of index two is normal.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that every subgroup of $Q_8$ is normal. Note, this is
  interesting, as $Q_8$ is not Abelian.
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
  Let $G$ be a group with subgroups $L$, $M$, and $N$. If
  \begin{align*}
    L &\normal M,\\
    N &\normal G,
  \end{align*}
  then, $NL\normal NM$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Show that if $G$ is a group, then the center (see
  Exercise~\ref{E:center}) $Z(G)$ is always normal in $G$.

  If you haven't already, you should also show that $Z(G)$ is subgroup
  of $G$.
\end{exercise}



This next lemma is inspired by Lemma~\ref{L:mawd} and
Lemma~\ref{mmwd}, and in fact, it proves both results.

\begin{lemma}[Coset product is well defined]
  Let $N$ be a subgroup of a group $(G,\star)$ withq $a,b\in G$.  The
  product on cosets
  \[
  (a\star N) \star (b\star N ) := (a\star b) N.
  \]
  is well defined if and only if $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
  \begin{proof}
    $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that $N\normal G$. We must show that if
    \begin{align*}
      a\star N &= a'\star N\\
      b\star N &= b'\star N,
    \end{align*}
    then $(a\star b) \star N = (a'\star b')\star N$.

    $(\Leftarrow)$
  \end{proof}
  
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}[Modular addition is well defined]
  Addition on $\Z_n$ is well defined.
\end{corollary}


\begin{corollary}[Modular multiplication is well defined]
  Multiplication on $\Z_n$ is well defined.
\end{corollary}
