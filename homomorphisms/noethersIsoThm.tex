\begin{theorem}[Noether's isomorphism theorem]\label{T:NI}\index{Noether's isomorphism theorem}\index{First isomorphism theorem}
  If $\phi:G\to H$ is a homomorphism of groups, then
  \[
  \frac{G}{\ker(\phi)} \iso \im(\phi).
  \]
  \begin{proof}
    \textbf{First we define a map from $\boldsymbol{\frac{G}{\ker(\phi)}}$ to $\boldsymbol{\im(\phi)}$.}
    Let $a,b\in G$. Set
    \begin{align*}
      \eta: \frac{G}{\ker(\phi)} &\to \im(\phi)\\
      a\ker(\phi) &\mapsto \phi(a).
    \end{align*}
    \textbf{We must check this map is
      well-defined.}\index{well-definied} Suppose
    \[
    a \ker(\phi) = b\ker(\phi).
    \]
    We must show that $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$. First note that if $a
    \ker(\phi) = b\ker(\phi)$, this means that $b\in
    a\ker(\phi)$. Hence $b = ak$ for some $k\in\ker(\phi)$. Now write
    with me
    \begin{align*}
      \phi(b) &=\phi(ak)\\
      &=\phi(a)\phi(k)\\
      &=\phi(a) e_H\\
      &=\phi(a).
    \end{align*}
    Since $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$, we see that $\eta$ is well-defined.


    
    \textbf{Now we must show that $\boldsymbol\eta$ is a
      homomorphism.} First recall that $\ker(\phi)$ is a normal
    subgroup of $G$, Lemma~\ref{L:kerN}, and that
    \[
    a\ker(\phi) b\ker(\phi)  =  ab\ker(\phi).
    \]
    Now write with me, 
    \begin{align*}
    \eta(a\ker(\phi) b\ker(\phi)) &= \eta(ab\ker(\phi))\\
    &= \phi(ab)\\
    &= \phi(a)\phi(b)\\
    &= \eta(a\ker(\phi)) \eta(b\ker(\phi)).
    \end{align*}



    \textbf{We must show that $\boldsymbol\eta$ is bijective.} Note
    $\eta$ is surjective by the defintion of $\im(\phi)$.  To see that
    $\eta$ is injective, note that if $\eta(a) = e_H$, then $a\in
    \ker(\phi)$, meaning
    \[
    a\equiv e_G \pmod{\ker(\phi)},
    \]
    hence $\eta$ is injective, and so $\eta$ is bijective. We have
    shown $\frac{G}{\ker(\phi)} \iso \im(\phi)$.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

Noether's isomorphism theorem above is saying something powerful about
group homomorphisms. It's saying that the \textbf{image of any
  homomorphism} from a group $G$ to any group $H$ is \textbf{always
  isomorphic to a quotient group of the target}.


\begin{corollary}[Canonical isomorphism]
  If $\pi:G\onto H$, is a surjective homomorphism of groups, then
  \[
  \frac{G}{\ker(\pi)} \iso H.
  \]
\end{corollary}
