\index{first isomorphism theorem}
Sometimes called the \textit{first isomorphism theorem}, Noether's
isomorphism theorem first appeared in her paper \link[\textit{Abstrakter
  Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und
  Funktionenk\"orpern}]{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01209152}.
For those who aren't in-the-know, \link[Emmy Noether]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy\_Noether} was one of the
greatest mathematicians of the 20th century. Let's see her isomorphism theorem.



\begin{theorem}[Noether's isomorphism theorem]\label{T:NI}\index{Noether's isomorphism theorem}\index{first isomorphism theorem}
  If $\phi:G\to H$ is a homomorphism of groups, then
  \[
  \frac{G}{\ker(\phi)} \iso \im(\phi).
  \]
  \begin{proof}
    To prove this theorem, we will construct the isomorphism
    above. We'll do this in a number of steps.


    \textbf{First we define a map from
      $\boldsymbol{\frac{G}{\ker(\phi)}}$ to
      $\boldsymbol{\im(\phi)}$.}  Let $a\in G$. Set
    \begin{align*}
      \eta: \frac{G}{\ker(\phi)} &\to \im(\phi)\\
      a\ker(\phi) &\mapsto \phi(a).
    \end{align*}
    \textbf{We must check this map is
      well-defined.}\index{well-defined} Suppose for $a,b\in G$
    \[
    a \ker(\phi) = b\ker(\phi).
    \]
    We must show that $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$. First note that if $a
    \ker(\phi) = b\ker(\phi)$, this means that $a\in
    b\ker(\phi)$. Hence $a = bk$ for some $k\in\ker(\phi)$. Now write
    with me
    \begin{align*}
      \phi(a) &=\phi(bk)\\
      &=\phi(b)\phi(k)\\
      &=\phi(b) e_H\\
      &=\phi(b).
    \end{align*}
    Since $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$, we see that $\eta$ is well-defined.


    
    \textbf{Now we must show that $\boldsymbol\eta$ is a
      homomorphism.} First recall that $\ker(\phi)$ is a normal
    subgroup of $G$, Lemma~\ref{L:kerN}, and so
    \[
    (a\ker(\phi)) (b\ker(\phi))  =  ab\ker(\phi)
    \]
    by Lemma~\ref{L:cpwd}.  Now write with me,
    \begin{align*}
    \eta\left((a\ker(\phi))( b\ker(\phi))\right) &= \eta(ab\ker(\phi))\\
    &= \phi(ab)\\
    &= \phi(a)\phi(b)\\
    &= \eta(a\ker(\phi)) \eta(b\ker(\phi)).
    \end{align*}



    \textbf{We must show that $\boldsymbol\eta$ is bijective.} Note
    $\eta$ is surjective by the definition of $\im(\phi)$.  To see that
    $\eta$ is injective, note that if $\eta(a) = e_H$, then $a\in
    \ker(\phi)$, meaning
    \[
    a\equiv e_G \pmod{\ker(\phi)},
    \]
    hence by Lemma~\ref{L:kerinj}, $\eta$ is injective.

    We have now shown $\eta$ is a bijective homomorphism, and hence an
    isomorphism. We conclude $\frac{G}{\ker(\phi)} \iso \im(\phi)$.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

Noether's isomorphism theorem above is saying something powerful about
group homomorphisms. It's saying that the \textbf{image of any
  homomorphism} from a group $G$ to any group $H$ is \textbf{always
  isomorphic to a quotient group $\boldsymbol{G/N}$}.


\begin{corollary}[Canonical isomorphism]
  If $\pi:G\onto H$, is a surjective homomorphism of groups, then
  \[
  \frac{G}{\ker(\pi)} \iso H.
  \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{example}[$\boldsymbol{\pmb\Z\pmb\to\pmb\Z_3}$]
  Consider the homomorphism of groups
  \begin{align*}
    \pi:\Z &\to \Z_3\\
    1 &\mapsto 1.
  \end{align*}
  Here $\ker(\phi)= 3\Z$, hence we see by Noether's isomorphism
  theorem that
  \[
  \frac{\Z}{3\Z}\iso \Z_3.
  \]
\end{example}



\begin{example}[Single variable calculus]
  Let $\R[x]$ denote the group of all polynomials in one variable with
  real coefficients under addition. Meaning
  \[
  f = a_nx^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0
  \]
  where $n\in\N\cup\{0\}$ and each $a_i\in\R$.  For each $f$ in $\R[x]$,
  let $f'$ denote the derivative of $f$. Show that the map
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{d}{dx}:\R[x]&\to\R[x]\\
    f  &\mapsto f'
  \end{align*}
  is a homomorphism of additive groups.



  In this case,
  \[
  \ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right) = \{c:c\in \R\}
  \]
  and
  \[
  \im\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right) =\R[x].
  \]
  Moreover, by Noether's isomorphism theorem,
  \[
  \frac{\R[x]}{\ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)} \iso \im\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right).
  \]
  The isomorphisms are given by
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\R[x]}{\ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)} &\to \im\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)\\
    f+\ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right) &\mapsto f'(x)
  \end{align*}
  and
  \[
  \im\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right) \lto^{\iota}\frac{\R[x]}{\ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)}
  \]
  where $\iota(f) = \int f \d x$.
\end{example}



So let's pause and reflect a little bit now. A standard calculus
problem goes something like this:

\begin{quote}
  \textit{Find the signed area between the $x$-axis and the function
    $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$.}
\end{quote}

From the example above we should see there is a connection between
solving a question like this one and homomorphisms. Let's make that
explicit now.

We can introduce two new homomorphims. First, the ``evaluation'' map,
  \begin{align*}
    [-]_a^b: \R[x]&\to\R\\
    f &\mapsto f(b)-f(a).
  \end{align*}
I'll leave it to you, my friend, to show that this a homomorphism from
$(\R[x],+)$ to $(\R,+)$.


Second, we need the signed ``area'' map,
  \begin{align*}
    \alpha_a^b :\R[x]&\to \R\\
    f &\mapsto \left(\begin{minipage}{2in}signed area between the $x$-axis and the function $f$ on
    the interval $[a,b]$.\end{minipage}\right)
  \end{align*}
Again, it's your task to show that this a homomorphism from
$(\R[x],+)$ to $(\R,+)$.

Finally, we can represent the solution to the calculus problem above
with the following diagram:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  \R[x] \ar[d,"{\alpha_a^b}",swap] \ar[r,"\iota"]  &  \frac{\R[x]}{\ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)} \ar[d,"{[-]_a^b}"]\\
  \R \ar[r,equal,"\text{F.T.C.}"]  & \R
\end{tikzcd}
\]
The \index{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus says that this diagram commutes, meaning
\[
  [\iota(f)]_a^b = \alpha_a^b(f).
\]
I like this diagram, and this way of thinking about calculus, because
it clarifies exactly what is happening at each step, disambiguation
the symbolic manipulation of functions from the statement of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
