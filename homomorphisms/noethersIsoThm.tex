\index{first isomorphism theorem}
Sometimes called the \textit{first isomorphism theorem}, Noether's
isomorphism theorem first appeared in her paper \link[\textit{Abstrakter
  Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und
  Funktionenk\"orpern}]{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01209152}.
For those who aren't in-the-know, \link[Emmy Noether]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy\_Noether} was one of the
greatest mathematicians of the 20th century. Let's see her isomorphism theorem.



\begin{theorem}[Noether's isomorphism theorem]\label{T:NI}\index{Noether's isomorphism theorem}\index{first isomorphism theorem}
  If $\phi:G\to H$ is a homomorphism of groups, then
  \[
  \frac{G}{\ker(\phi)} \iso \im(\phi).
  \]
  \begin{proof}
    To prove this theorem, we will construct the isomorphism
    above. We'll do this in a number of steps.


    \textbf{First we define a map from
      $\boldsymbol{\frac{G}{\ker(\phi)}}$ to
      $\boldsymbol{\im(\phi)}$.}  Let $a\in G$. Set
    \begin{align*}
      \eta: \frac{G}{\ker(\phi)} &\to \im(\phi)\\
      a\ker(\phi) &\mapsto \phi(a).
    \end{align*}
    \textbf{We must check this map is
      well-defined.}\index{well-defined} Suppose for $a,b\in G$
    \[
    a \ker(\phi) = b\ker(\phi).
    \]
    We must show that $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$. First note that if $a
    \ker(\phi) = b\ker(\phi)$, this means that $a\in
    b\ker(\phi)$. Hence $a = bk$ for some $k\in\ker(\phi)$. Now write
    with me
    \begin{align*}
      \phi(a) &=\phi(bk)\\
      &=\phi(b)\phi(k)\\
      &=\phi(b) e_H\\
      &=\phi(b).
    \end{align*}
    Since $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$, we see that $\eta$ is well-defined.


    
    \textbf{Now we must show that $\boldsymbol\eta$ is a
      homomorphism.} First recall that $\ker(\phi)$ is a normal
    subgroup of $G$, Lemma~\ref{L:kerN}, and so
    \[
    (a\ker(\phi)) (b\ker(\phi))  =  ab\ker(\phi)
    \]
    by Lemma~\ref{L:cpwd}.  Now write with me,
    \begin{align*}
    \eta\left((a\ker(\phi))( b\ker(\phi))\right) &= \eta(ab\ker(\phi))\\
    &= \phi(ab)\\
    &= \phi(a)\phi(b)\\
    &= \eta(a\ker(\phi)) \eta(b\ker(\phi)).
    \end{align*}



    \textbf{We must show that $\boldsymbol\eta$ is bijective.} Note
    $\eta$ is surjective by the defintion of $\im(\phi)$.  To see that
    $\eta$ is injective, note that if $\eta(a) = e_H$, then $a\in
    \ker(\phi)$, meaning
    \[
    a\equiv e_G \pmod{\ker(\phi)},
    \]
    hence by Lemma~\ref{L:kerinj}, $\eta$ is injective.

    We have now shown $\eta$ is a bijective homomorphism, and hence an
    isomorphism. We conclude $\frac{G}{\ker(\phi)} \iso \im(\phi)$.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

Noether's isomorphism theorem above is saying something powerful about
group homomorphisms. It's saying that the \textbf{image of any
  homomorphism} from a group $G$ to any group $H$ is \textbf{always
  isomorphic to a quotient group $\boldsymbol{G/N}$}.


\begin{corollary}[Canonical isomorphism]
  If $\pi:G\onto H$, is a surjective homomorphism of groups, then
  \[
  \frac{G}{\ker(\pi)} \iso H.
  \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{example}[$\boldsymbol{\pmb\Z\pmb\to\pmb\Z_3}$]
  Consider the homomorphism of groups
  \begin{align*}
    \pi:\Z &\to \Z_3\\
    1 &\mapsto 1.
  \end{align*}
  Here $\ker(\phi)= 3\Z$, hence we see by Noether's isomorphism
  theorem that
  \[
  \frac{\Z}{3\Z}\iso \Z_3.
  \]
\end{example}



\begin{example}[Single variable calculus]
  Let $\R[x]$ denote the group of all polynomials in one variable with
  real coefficients under addition. Meaning
  \[
  f = a_nx^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0
  \]
  where $n\in\N\cup\{0\}$ and each $a_i\in\R$.  For each $f$ in $\R[x]$,
  let $f'$ denote the derivative of $f$. Show that the map
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{d}{dx}:\R[x]&\to\R[x]\\
    f  &\mapsto f'
  \end{align*}
  is a homomorphism of additive groups.  In this case,
  \[
  \ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right) = \{c:c\in \R\}
  \]
  and
  \[
  \im\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right) =\R[x].
  \]
  Moveover, by Noether's isomorphism theorem,
  \[
  \frac{\R[x]}{\ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)} \iso \im\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right).
  \]
  The isomorphisms are given by
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\R[x]}{\ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)} &\to \im\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)\\
    f+\ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right) &\mapsto f'(x)
  \end{align*}
  and
  \[
  \im\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right) \lto^{\iota}\frac{\R[x]}{\ker\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)}
  \]
  where $\iota(f) = \int f \d x$.
\end{example}
