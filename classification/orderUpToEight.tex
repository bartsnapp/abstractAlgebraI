\maketitle

This section may be too demanding of the average reader. However, you
are no average reader! You are an intreped young mathematician!

We, and by we, I kind of mean \textit{you}, are going to classify all
groups up to order eight. This means that for each order, you will
find a set of groups such that any group of that order is isomorphic
to a group in your list.

To start your goal is to fill-in the boxes in the theorem and lemmas
below.

\begin{theorem}[Classification of groups up to order eight]
  There are \framebox(30,20){} isomorphism classes of groups up to
  order eight. The specfic list of isomorphism classes will be listed
  below by order.
\end{theorem}


\section{Orders one}

\begin{lemma}[Groups of order one]
  The group of order one is isomorphic to:
  \[
  \framebox(300,100){}
  \]
  \begin{sketch}
    There's only one! (I claim this is a hilarous pun.)
  \end{sketch}
\end{lemma}

\section{Order two, three, five, and seven}

We will prove a stronger result.

\begin{lemma}[Groups of prime order]
  The groups of prime order are isomorphic to:
  \[
  \framebox(300,100){}
  \]
  \begin{sketch}
    Prove these groups are always cyclic.
  \end{sketch}
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}[Groups of prime order less than eight]
  The groups of prime order less than eight are isomorphic to one of:
  \[
  \framebox(300,100){}
  \]
\end{corollary}

\section{Order four}

\section{Order six}

\section{Order eight}

Prove that a non-Abelian group of order eight with a single element of
order $2$ is isomorphic to $Q_8$.
